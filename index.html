        <h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently studying machine learning theory from a few books and also a project developer on the University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Team

        <h2>Projects (planned and completed) </h2>
        <i>I'm a firm believer that the fundementals of anything must be mastered before one delves into it, which is  why I usually take a long <br> time to understand the mathematics behind a project before starting it</i>

        <ul>
            <li>I have attended 6 hackathons, most can be found on my <a href = "https://devpost.com/aditmeh123" target="_blank">Devpost</a></li>
            <li>One hackathon project (not listed on devpost) that I'm particularly proud of, a teammate wrote a nice article about it <a href = "    https://medium.com/@mustafa.khan670093/astrotech-developing-asteroid-detection-technology-for-the-csa-f24c1ba23eef

            <li>Automatic image captioning using attention-based neural networks</li>
            <li>I have a list of kaggle datasets I plan on tackling as soon as I finish up with some theory in classical ML</li>
